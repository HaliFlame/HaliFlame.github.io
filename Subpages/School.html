  <h1>Dulwich College Beijing</h1>
    <p>First and foremost, I personally think school should take up a whole section on my website because it plays such an important role in my life. Ranging from soccer to badminton, activities offered in my school are carried out in a friendly and competitive environment! The classes aren't dreadful - most of the time - and the staffs are shaping me to become a better person through countless patient tutoring and strategically-planned lessons. Without further bragging, let me introduce my school to you so you can have a general idea of DCB.</p>
  <p>Dulwich College Beijing is a British International school located in Beijing, China. I was accepted, on July 2012, as a year 7 (Senior school student).</p>
  <p>There are 13 years of school years in total. From year 7 to year 9, the school offers generalised subjects e.g. science, instead of physics, chemistry and biology. During these years, you are expected to have a general grasp of what subject you are interested in. During year 10 and year 11, you enter IGCSE which the final results will be looked up by British universities if you apply. You get to choose subjects you like from six groups, these subject choices are imperative as it lays down a foundation for IB (year 12 and 13). The past five years are basically preparation for IB - a rigorous course that our school require you to select 3-4 Higher Level subjects and 2-3 Standard Level subjects - your subject preferences from IGCSE matters as you have an advantage if you select the same subject. However, you cannot escape from taking Math and English.</p>
