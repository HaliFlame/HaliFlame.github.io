# Welcome to Jekyll!


# In addition to these settings, there is a file _data/tokens-template.yml
# that you'll want to customize for your site. It's named 'tokens' because
# that was it's original purpose, but because tokens.yml is .gitexcluded, it's
# a good place to store your site-specific data that you'd rather not have
# forked or cloned. Of course, that means you'd want to back it up elsewhere.

# Also, for your post bylines, add author info for yourself in `_data/authors.yml`.
# (Using that method instead of site.owner, in case your posts get cloned with your repo.)

# if you use this repo's `ruby compose.rb` script to initiate new posts, put the
# command to invoke your editor here. (I didn't spend time dealing with spaces
# and full paths of the various OSes in compose.rb. For my Windows
# environment, I just put a subl.cmd file in my PATH that points to the full
# path to Sublime's subl.exe.) Also, put your most common post extension.
